Epic, look at me rushing in last minute like everyone else.

# The Games Foxes Play

*"A mechanical clay sentinel, tasked to protect the Saint's palaces until the end times. As progress marched on, walls thickened with steel and concrete, but Abazon refused to budge from its post, and was soon engulfed. Rumour says it still stands there, immured and paralyzed, waiting to strike out with extreme prejudice at any who'd dare dig out its tomb."*

# Elevator Pitch

If you cut past the flowery prose and indiscernable glyphs, at its core, it's a spell-crafting roguelike. **FORMS**, like "everything touched by a beam" or "on yourself", determine where effects happen. **FUNCTIONS**, like "dash forwards" or "receive a regeneration status effect", determine what the effect is. You also have some **MUTATORS**, which do zany things like force other creatures to cast spells or place traps on the ground which cast a spell when stepped on.

No, none of this is in the itch.io link above. It used to be in the JavaScript version I worked 1.5 years on. That one will rot forever, the code choked itself to death with its Wall of Global Variables and other accursed hacks.

I'm better now. I remade the crafting system. [For example, in this screenshot](https://i.postimg.cc/C1fCVyZJ/image.png), the two yellow Souls on the left of the 3x3 grid are "laser beam", and the orange Souls on the right are "transform creature into a Terracotta Sentry". The purple @ is me, and I transformed the creature on the left into a salmon-coloured Sentry using my new spell.

# 2024 Retrospective

I failed at giving up.

I used to [post a ton on this forum](https://oneirical.github.io/tags/tgfp/), then stopped. I was certain that I was wasting my time. That I should be doing something useful with my newfound coding skills instead of playing around in my pixelated doll-house. But, this idea refuses to leave me alone until it has a place to call home.

I've found out that the less I care, the better I become. I just shut off my brain and get cracking, no wasting time reading gamedev blogs or agonizing over how this project is bad/uncreative/uninteresting/etc.

In this new iteration, the code is better, the UI looks nicer, and I remade 1.5 years of progress in only 4 months. I'm getting better. The game is fun again. [I published a super barebones, but playable and fun demo](https://oneirical.itch.io/tgfp) accessible from a web window, something which I haven't done in the last 18 months. I scrapped all the nonsensical, unfun ideas. I started from a good idea and deteriorated into the ravings of a lunatic. No more of that. Back to the roots.

# Technical Tutorial

In terms of technical details, it's pure Rust + Bevy. But, that's of little importance. When making a game, having as little neurons as possible dedicated to "engines" and "languages" is crucial. Just pick up the pickaxe and hit the rock.

I still imagine some may be interested in my methodology with these technologies, so, **[here you go](https://oneirical.github.io/tags/bevy/)**. An in-depth tutorial on the basic pieces that make up my game with GIFs, code snippets and explanations.

# 2025 Outlook

If I think about it too long, I get swarmed by thoughts that I should just be cranking out pull requests on high profile open source projects instead of endangering my career development by wasting my time on this.

Ironically, I've been chatting with a couple of people doing some low-level compiler optimization technowizardry and they all agree that my silly little game idea is really cool and asked enough questions for me to believe they aren't pretending to be interested.

Doesn't matter. The less I think about any of this, the better. In the near future, I plan on keeping my head down and releasing a new itch.io demo where you have a "crafting spellbook" randomized each run and clear 17x17 rooms of enemies with your creations. As long as I find myself actually enjoying the process of "let's just do a few runs and see if I find any bugs", I am on the right track.

Oh, and at a real-life board gaming event I went to last week, someone asked me if I was "oneirical" and said they used to read my posts in r/roguelikedev. If you're reading this, hello!
