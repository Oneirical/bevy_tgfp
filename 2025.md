# The Games Foxes Play

*"A mechanical clay sentinel, tasked to protect the Saint's palaces until the end times. As progress marched on, walls thickened with steel and concrete, but Abazon refused to budge from its post, and was soon engulfed. Rumour says it still stands there, immured and paralyzed, waiting to strike out with extreme prejudice at any who'd dare dig out its tomb."*

# Elevator Pitch

# Obligatory Emotional Pep Talk

I failed at giving up.

I used to post a ton on this forum, then stopped. I was certain that I was wasting my time. That I should be doing something useful with my newfound coding skills instead of playing around in my pixelated doll-house. But, this idea refuses to leave me alone until it has a place to call home.

I've found out that the less I care, the better I become. I just shut off my brain and get cracking, no wasting time reading gamedev blogs.

In this new iteration, the code is better, the UI looks nicer, and I remade 1.5 years of progress in only 4 months. I'm getting better. The game is fun again. [I published a super barebones, but playable and fun demo](https://oneirical.itch.io/tgfp) accessible from a web window, something which I haven't done in the last 18 months. I scrapped all the nonsensical, unfun ideas. I started from a good idea and deteriorated into the ravings of a lunatic. No more of that. Back to the roots.

# Technical Tutorial

In terms of technical details, it's pure Rust + Bevy. But, that's of little importance. When making a game, having as little neurons as possible dedicated to "engines" and "languages" is crucial. Just pick up the pickaxe and hit the rock.

I still imagine some may be interested in my methodology with these technologies, so, **[here you go](https://oneirical.github.io/tags/bevy/)**. An in-depth tutorial on the basic pieces that make up my game with GIFs, code snippets and explanations.
